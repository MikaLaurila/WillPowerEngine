# Scripting with Luau

WillPowerEngine runs entity behavior in [Luau](https://luau.org) scripts. Each script file returns a table of callbacks (its "class"). Every entity that has the script attached gets its own instance table, `self`.

```lua
local Spinner = {}

function Spinner:on_start()             -- once, before the first on_update
	self.speed = 1.5                    -- instance state lives on self
end

function Spinner:on_update(dt)          -- every frame (variable dt)
	wpe.rotate(self.entity, vector.create(0, 1, 0), self.speed * dt)
end

function Spinner:on_fixed_update(dt)    -- every fixed simulation step (physics-aligned)
end

function Spinner:on_destroy()           -- component removed, entity destroyed, or host shut down
end

function Spinner:on_reload()            -- after hot reload; self keeps all its fields
	self.speed = 1.5                    -- re-apply constants that on_start set
end

return Spinner
```

`self.entity` holds the entity handle. All callbacks are optional.

## Lifecycle and rules

- **Callback order:**
  - `on_start` runs during the first update after the script is attached.
  - `on_fixed_update` only begins after `on_start` has run.
  - `on_destroy` runs only for instances that started.
- **Changing the world:** scripts may spawn, modify and destroy entities freely during `on_start`, `on_update` and `on_fixed_update`. `wpe.destroy` is deferred: the entity and its children are destroyed at the end of the current update.
- **Inside `on_destroy`:** you may read and modify components and call `wpe.destroy`. Spawning, attaching scripts, adding/removing lights and reparenting raise errors there.
- **Errors:** an error in a callback is logged with a stack trace, and that instance is disabled until its script is reloaded. Other scripts keep running.
- **Budgets:** each callback has a time budget (infinite loops are interrupted), and the VM has a memory limit. Hitting either counts as an error.
- **Hot reload:** keeps every instance's state and swaps in the new code. A file that fails to compile leaves the previous version running.

## Sandbox

- **Available:** the Luau standard libraries `math`, `string`, `table`, `coroutine`, `bit32`, `utf8`, `buffer`, `vector`, and `os.time/clock/date/difftime`.
- **Not available:** `io`, `loadstring`/`load`, `require`, `dofile`, `getfenv`/`setfenv`, and any other `os` functions.
- **Read-only:** globals and libraries can't be modified.
- **Separate globals per file:** each script file has its own global environment, so globals never leak between files.
- **Paths:** script and prefab paths are relative to the project's asset root and use forward slashes. They can't be absolute or contain `..`.

## API reference (`wpe`)

Entity handles are numbers. Passing a handle that isn't alive raises an error. Vectors use Luau's built-in `vector` type (`vector.create(x, y, z)`; arithmetic and `vector.magnitude`, `vector.normalize`, `vector.dot` and `vector.cross` work as usual).

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `wpe.log(...)` / `print(...)` | Log the arguments (separated by spaces) at INFO level, tagged with the script location. |
| `wpe.spawn([name]) -> entity` | Create an entity with an identity Transform and an optional name. |
| `wpe.destroy(entity)` | Destroy an entity and its children at the end of the current update. Dead handles are ignored. |
| `wpe.is_alive(entity) -> bool` | Whether the handle refers to a live entity. |
| `wpe.get_name(entity) -> string?` / `wpe.set_name(entity, name)` | Display name. |
| `wpe.get_parent(entity) -> entity?` | Parent, or nil. |
| `wpe.set_parent(entity, parent?, keep_world = true)` | Reparent (nil detaches). With `keep_world`, the world placement is preserved. |
| `wpe.children(entity) -> {entity}` | Direct children in order. |
| `wpe.instantiate(prefab, [position]) -> entity` | Instantiate a registered prefab, or a glTF path relative to the asset root. Returns the root entity. An animated model starts playing its first animation. |
| `wpe.attach_script(entity, path) -> bool` | Attach (or replace) a script. |
| `wpe.get_position(entity)` / `wpe.set_position(entity, v)` | Local position. |
| `wpe.get_rotation(entity)` / `wpe.set_rotation(entity, euler)` | Local rotation as XYZ Euler angles in radians (applied X, then Y, then Z). |
| `wpe.rotate(entity, axis, radians)` | Rotate around an axis given in parent space. |
| `wpe.get_scale(entity)` / `wpe.set_scale(entity, v or number)` | Local scale. |
| `wpe.get_world_position(entity)` | World-space position, computed from the current transforms. |
| `wpe.forward(entity)` | World-space forward direction (local −Z). |
| `wpe.look_at(entity, target, [up])` | Turn so that forward points at a world-space target. |
| `wpe.set_light(entity, {type, color, intensity, range, inner_cone, outer_cone, shadows})` | Add or update a light. Missing fields keep their current values (or the defaults). |
| `wpe.get_light(entity) -> table?` / `wpe.remove_light(entity)` | Read or remove a light. |
| `wpe.LIGHT_DIRECTIONAL`, `wpe.LIGHT_POINT`, `wpe.LIGHT_SPOT` | Light type constants. |
| `wpe.set_visible(entity, bool)` | Show or hide every mesh in the entity's subtree. |
| `wpe.play_animation(entity, [index], [loop = true])` | Play an instantiated model's animation (1-based index). nil keeps the current one. |
| `wpe.stop_animation(entity)` | Pause playback. |
| `wpe.animation_time(entity, [seconds]) -> seconds` | Get or set the playback position. |
| `wpe.time() -> seconds` | Accumulated game time from updates. |
| `wpe.frame() -> number` | Number of completed updates. |

`assets/scripts/api_tour.luau` exercises every function above. The integration test runs it for 60 simulated seconds.

## Hosting from C

```c
WPE_ScriptHost* host;
wpe_script_host_create(&(WPE_ScriptHostDesc){.ecs = ecs, .asset_root = "assets"}, &host);
wpe_script_host_register_prefab(host, "box", box_model);   // optional named prefabs
wpe_script_attach(host, entity, "scripts/spinner.luau");

// Per frame (see samples/script_demo):
uint32_t steps = wpe_fixed_step_advance(&clock, frame_dt);
for (uint32_t i = 0; i < steps; ++i) wpe_script_host_fixed_update(host, clock.step);
wpe_script_host_update(host, frame_dt);
wpe_script_host_reload_changed(host);                       // e.g. a few times per second while editing

wpe_script_host_destroy(host);                              // before destroying the world
```
